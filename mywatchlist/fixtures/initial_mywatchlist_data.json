Perfect start to the marvel world we know and love. unfortunately the antagonist was a bit boring, but except for that, I loved the movie!"

            "review":"It isn't as good as the original but Iron Man 2 is still a really good sequel. Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell all give great performances. Jon Favreau's direction is really good and it's consistently funny. The CG is impressive and the music by John Denney is good. However, Mickey Rourke is wasted as a forgettable villain and the final battle is a little short."

            "review":"This is a movie that stands very differently with a lot of people, but to me, it is a very entertaining and well-directed film about a God needs to learn what it means to be a man. Kenneth Branagh is a visionary and every single shot in this movie is beautifully made and you get the feeling that he really put his heart and soul into this. The performances of Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins are great, but it is Tom Hiddleston's Loki that totally steals the movie."

I loved the casting, Chris Evans, Haylee Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper and Hugo Weaving. This is a personal favorite and I think this movie is my 3rd favorite MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movie. An amazing origin story, showing us who Captain America was, and how he is now. I recommend this for family movie nights, or just for fun!"

Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon."

Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation."

With an effective mix of thrilling action, humor, intrigue, and surprising heart, it is another great addition to the Infinity Saga."
